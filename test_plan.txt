// We need the API key. Since we don't have it easily in env (it's in .env or passed from client), 
// I will ask the user to provide it or try to grab from .env if possible.
// Wait, the backend has been receiving it. I'll create a script that expects CLI arg or I'll try to find .env
// For now, I'll write the script to just use a placeholder and I will try to run it if I can see the key in .env? 
// No, I shouldn't peek at .env via cat if I can avoid it.
// I will modify the script to read from process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY and I will try to run it.
// If it fails, I will use a dummy one and see if it works? No.

// Actually, I can use the existing `route.ts` logic to log the models if I hit a specific endpoint?
// Or I can just write a script and run it with `GEMINI_API_KEY=... node list-models.js`.
// But I don't have the key in my context openly.

// Let's look at `d:\0. 안티그래비티\롤플레잉 생성기\roleplay-gen\.env` ? 
// The user has `.env.example`. I don't know if `.env` exists.
// Let's check `ls -a`.

// Better idea: Modify the `test-edge-tts.js` to *also* try to fetch google translate TTS.
// And I will try to fix Edge TTS 403 by adding headers.
